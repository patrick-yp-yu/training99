# Unity Game Project: Training99

This folder contains Unity source codes for our game project - Training99. The game is a bullet-hell action game, but not just dodging. Using color-matching and shape-matching mechanisms, we have three types of gaming modes:level mode, endless mode, and versus mode to challenge playersâ€™ hand-eye coordination. Trying to not be shot, the longer the better!
